# Trabajo_RNAseq

to run the pipeline you only have to run the following command:

bash pipeline.sh

To see the dependencies you have to run the command bash version.sh.

I have even created a .yml (RNAseq_DavidRubio.yml) so that you can recreate the environment.

To answer section two just run the pipeline.sh, in the memory is the explanation of each part of the code.


On the other hand, for section 2 another environment has been created by copying the dge_lessons class environment and in the same memory all the steps followed are explained as well as the R script and the GSEA results.
